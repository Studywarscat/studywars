    Meet Vishu(^o^), a regular kid with zero interest in hitting the books. Studying was like a chore to him, and he'd do anything to avoid it. One day, while aimlessly scrolling the internet, he stumbled upon this thing called "spaced repetition."
<br><br>
<br>
Intrigued, he thought, "Why not give it a shot?" Instead of his usual study method, he decided to break things down. He made flashcards, focusing on the important bits. It sounded a bit too simple, but hey, desperate times called for desperate measures.<br><br>
<br>
Now, Vishu wasn't exactly the poster child for routines, so sticking to this new plan was a bit of a struggle. But, being the rebel he was, he stuck with it just to see what would happen.<br><br>
<br>
To his surprise, spaced repetition wasn't half bad. It made studying, dare he say it, kind of easy. The technique had this way of making sure he revisited stuff at just the right times, making it stick without the mind-killing cram sessions(＞﹏＜). Bonus? His grades improved without turning him into a study zombie.<br><br>
<br>
Word got out about Vishu's newfound study hack, and suddenly, his buddies were curious. He spilled the secret – spaced repetition. Out of nowhere, the guy who used to dodge textbooks became the go-to guru for study tips.<br><br>
<br>
In the end, Vishu figured out that studying didn't have to be this excruciating thing. With spaced repetition, he cracked the code to making it more efficient and way less painful. And just like that, the kid who once scoffed at textbooks became the unexpected hero of smarter studying, proving you didn't need to sacrifice your social life to get those good grades.
